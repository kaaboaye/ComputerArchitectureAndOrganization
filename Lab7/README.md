## Task
  1. Write a program which calculate the value of the following expression
    ```
      ( a + b ) – ( c – d )
    ```
  2. Execute program using go and single step commands
  3. Compare source code with the code generated by the simulator, what
    differences you determine.

## Program description
  Program reads from standard input for numbers `A`, `B`, `C` and `D`.
  In the next step calculates the value of expression given in the task
  using equivalent expression `a + b - c + d` which can be easier implemented
  using assembly language.

  In order to minimize code duplicates procedure `read` was created. This
  procedure prints string given in `$a0` then reads an integer from standard
  input.

## Differences between source code and code generated by the simulator
  - Only comments by a source code are visible
  - `la` instruction is divided into two instructions: `lui` and `ori`
  - Labels from `.data` segment are replaced by integer address.

## Conclusions
  - MIPS assembly compiler uses macro which make operations like `la` easier
    to implement.
  - We should use procedures or functions always when there is possibility
    to avoid duplication of the source code.
